This is an example of a chatbot developed using IBM watsonx Assistant

This shows the testing window where the chatbot returns answers and some information about the intents that triger the responses. The Intents and Entities help guide the chatbot to respond appropriately. Configuring the connections between potential user prompts in the entities and intents sections through the Dialoge set up the relationships that the ChatBot AI can then rely on to pick a response.
